            This is the thigny page, where im going to write down soo much stuff its gonna hurt your eyes :O
            O_O
            look at all this text! well.. you can look at it, but i cant see it while im writing it! soo sad, but cool to think that i cant see it, but future me could, and whoever in there right mind who would want to read this could!
            woweeeeeee but more important things, the question on LITTIRALLY EVERYONES mind is...
            does paper taste better than plastic?
            *cheaks notes* 
            WAIT NO thats not it...
            the real question is...
            is paper as good at holding mass amounts of data as a digital format?
            hmmmm... well i would say it could, but i doupt it would be the most efficient way as paper reqires ink, wearas computer data is... magic! or electicity... magics more exciting tho, anyway, what was i talking about?
            oh yeah paper vs digital, i think digital data would be better as its much esier and more efficiant to read/write to, in a computers sense, but i think paper is best as a long term storage, kinda like cold storage? because paper in the right coditions could last for donkeys years! well... *cheaks notes* i think it could, who knows im not a rocket sientist! i can barly spell sientist! :D 
            anyway, thats my thoughts on paper vs digital, what are yours? <button>Paper is better!</button> or <button>Digital is better!</button> :D
            the next best topic is why i put buttons there, well... its because i can! mwahahaha! :D and dont ask why they dont work, its too hard to code >:C 
            anyway, thanks for reading my random thoughts, see you next time! :D
            what? who is this imposter writing in my thingy page? get out of here you no good... imposter! :O
            oh wait thats spellcheak... well anyway, this page shall continue for the end of time! mwahahaha! :D
            i wonder if i can beat the record for the longest page? what is that anyway? hmmmm 
            doupt that tho, i think its like 20million :O id be ded as a dinosour before writing all that! :D 
            stupid spellcheak keeps wanthing to say bye! even spellcheak thinks this is too many words heheheh
            me just relized that this text im writing is kinda hard to read on the website... maybe i should add a button that changes the font to somthing easier to read? hmmmm
            just imagine this <button onclick="document.querySelector('main p').classList.toggle('easy-read')">Change Font</button> does that! (Note to future self, make this work!)
            why dont you test that button, see if future me actually did make it work, or just left it as a button that does nothing :D
            or maybe i DID try but it was too hard and gave up, thats deffintly a possibility heheheh
            oh i just had a brainwave, here, have 2 more tottaly usefull buttons! (Not to be confused with 2 tottaly useless buttons!) <button onclick="changeFontSize(2)">Bigger ðŸ˜Ž</button> and this one! <button onclick="changeFontSize(-2)">Smaller ðŸ˜´</button>
            and if they do somthing great! means future me did do somthing, but if not, you should shame future me :D its all his fault! <button id="shameButton">SHAME!</button> and just imagine theres a counter here that is a shame limit hehehe:
            <strong>SHAME LIMIT!: <span id="shameCounter">10</span></strong>
            and just imagine that it goes down every time you shame, and only resets arfter 1 minute >:D and dont even think about refreshing your browser, i thought of that! so its saved in local storage hehehehe well.. that is if future me actually worked out how to implement that... 
            poor future me, hes gonna have soo much to do heheheh >:D 
            i should write a story! hmmmm
            what would the story be about tho... *Magical poof noise*! read it here!: <strong>*Insert link to story that future me made*</strong>
